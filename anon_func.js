/* Let's do a quick warmup to verify that you understand how to define
functions which take other functions. In this case, build a SimpleObject
constructor which makes an object that contains a collection inside of it and
also a method called each which allows you to iterate over that collection
using a passed-in function: */

myObj.collection = [1, "foo", 3];
myObj.each(function(el, index) {
  console.log("Item " + index + " is " + el);
});

/* Now let's add a method to the SimpleObject function itself. Let's create a
method each that takes two parameters. The first is a collection, and the
second is a callback function that passes the element and index as arguments.*/

});
